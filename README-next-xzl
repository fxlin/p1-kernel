roadmap... 
exp7: 
    sync (spinlock, sleeplock) & corresponding sched support (sleep, etc.)
    more syscalls
    more vm functions. copyin, copyout

block layer, buf, vfs, filesys, disk driver (so that we can have basicaly fs tree working)
    disk driver woulnd't be necessary but it's tightly coupled with vfs at this time. 

console, uart (improved)
    b/c user now needs to call sys_write() to console. uart driver needs to support multithreading
        also irq driven

NEXT -- improved uart driver, then enable console. 

NEXT --- fixe bug. cf sysfile.c 293
